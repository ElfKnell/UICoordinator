            In the next section of the app, you can **share posts** that other users can see and use.
            
            Each post may include:
            â€¢ A marker with a specific location  
            â€¢ A title and description
            â€¢ Photos 
            
            Shared posts can be **opened in map, updated, and reused** by other users.  
            This helps build a community-based library of useful locations and recommendations.
